 - **Rotate Offset** - Something similar to Move Offset, where the rotation is
   based on the parent/target... or something like "look at"
 - **Channels for Object Scope** - Open up more memory options, allowing things
   like Objects tracking their own Value in tandem with ownership and state
etc. Lots of options (though probably a memory issue)
 - **Set the name of a NavPoint with a number** - With as many numbers as we
   have access to now, using NavPoints to visually display those numbers would
be SUPER helpful
 - **Add more conditions to multi** - Having things in Multi like
   Number:Checking could prove to be very very valuable moving forward
 - **Allow Filtering in Conditions** - Some conditions would be made much
   easier if we could do filtering to target specific players, or objects
