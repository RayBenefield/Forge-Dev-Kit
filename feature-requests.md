 - **Rotate Offset** - Something similar to Move Offset, where the rotation is
   based on the parent/target... or something like "look at"
 - **Channels for Object Scope** - Open up more memory options, allowing things
   like Objects tracking their own Value in tandem with ownership and state
etc. Lots of options (though probably a memory issue)
