# Halo Forge Development Kit [Halo FDK]

Welcome to the Halo FDK. With the release of the Monitor's Bounty update,
Forge's scripting system has become more like a scripting language. There are a
lot of aspects of it that allow Forgers to generalize, re-use, and standardize
their scripting systems for gametypes. Software engineering practices like
refactoring, decoupling, modularity, debugging, testing, etc. have become more
important than ever.


## Overview of Goals

The FDK hopes to achieve a lot by bringing together the community in an open
source fashion:

 - Push a collaborative open source effort between forgers to improve the Halo
   Community (e.g. community decisions, issues, pull requests, version
tracking, etc.)
 - Bringing back classic Halo gametypes for the community to enjoy (e.g.
   Stockpile, Headhunter, VIP, Juggernaut, Regicide, etc.)
 - Enabling multiple gametypes based on the new Mini-Game gametype on a single
   map (e.g. Adding all of the above and more to the same map without multiple
map variants)
 - Provide a location to find scripting documentation in a readable accessible
   form (e.g. documenting the memory system, documents in Markdown format,
etc.)
 - Expose design documents for all gametypes that are added to the FDK to serve
   as an example for other forgers (e.g. How to build KoTH, Race, Invasion,
Fury, etc.)
 - Pushing gametypes to the limits in terms of customization for forgers (e.g.
   Infinite phases in Invasion, Unlimited hills for KoTH, etc.)
 - Setting up centralized standards like similar channel usage (e.g. Message
   Channel India for Initialization, Power Channel Golf for Game On/Off, etc.)
 - Provide patterns to common problems in complex scripting (e.g. Tracking
   Player Deaths, Looping over an arbitrary number of objects, etc.)
 - Encourage reusable prefabs to make creating complex gametypes easier and
   faster (e.g. Game Managers, Round Managers, Spawn Managers, etc.)
 - Put a focus on debugging and testing to ensure faster iteration, higher
   quality, and stability (e.g. Verify gametypes work in Forge using switches,
navpoints, score, etc.)
 - Provide a centralized place to file bugs and feature requests for the
   scripting system (e.g. Maximizing the action filtering system, fixing memory
channels, etc.)
 - Provide reason for 343 to continue supporting and improving the User
   Generated Content capabilities of Halo (e.g. more Forge support, more
Gametype options, etc.)
