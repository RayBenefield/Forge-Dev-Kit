# Killer Ball

In this gametype a random ball spawns and starts moving forward, when it hits a
wall it will bounce off into a different direction. If this ball comes into
contact with any player it will kill them. Over time more balls spawn and it
gets harder to stay alive. Players have the ability to build and manipulate
structures that make the ball bounce off to try to target other players with
the ball to kill them. Last man alive wins.
