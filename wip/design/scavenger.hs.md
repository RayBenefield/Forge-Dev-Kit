# Scavenger

Each player is given 3 things that they need to hide. Those things travel
around with the player until the player places them down. Waypoints become
available on them for all players, but only within a short distance. Players
must go around and hunt for the valuables of others to tag them as their own.
After a player tags them, a minute later the original owner of it gets untagged
and notified that someone took it. The goal is to have the most tagged
valuables on the map.
