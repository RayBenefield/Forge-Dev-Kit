# Follow the Leader

In this gametype a single leader on each team is given the responsibility to be
followed, players from the other team must follow the leader. If they don't
follow the leader, they die. If the entire enemy team behind a leader is killed
due to not propertly following the leader, that Leader's team wins.

This is a game equivalent to Simon Says and Basketball's H.O.R.S.E. Players
must do everything as the leader does within X amount of time. If they don't do
it within the window of time that the action was done, then they will die.


## Leader

The leader must run around as quickly as possible, making skill jumps, hitting
targets, activating switches, etc. The map is a sandbox of options, and the
leader has their pick of what to do. As the leader does actions, the game
tracks where and what the leader is doing. Then a requirement is placed on the
enemey team to follow along or die. The leader must make things as complicated
as possible to try to throw off the enemy team.


## Followers

The followers must watch everything that the leader of the enemy team does.
They must follow and replicate every action done by the enemy leader or they
risk dying. When all of them die, the enemy team wins.
