Patterns refer to a particular way to solve a problem. These patterns can help
you solve extremely complex problems in Halo Forge's scripting system.

   objects and do things

   unnecessary events
 - [**Conditional Math**](./conditional-math.hs.md) - Use math to create Number
   Check multi-conditions
